# Estonian language pack to localize the [Flarum](http://flarum.org/) forum software.

## Installation

Flarum uses Composer to manage its dependencies and extensions. The Estonian language pack is available [on Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/lilcode/flarum-ext-estonian) and can be managed that way. Make sure that [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is installed on your machine, then run the following command in the location where Flarum is installed:

```shell
composer require lilcode/flarum-ext-estonian
```
